croc_review_30,"A great option for house/pool shoes. Was looking for something with more protection than flip flops as my toddlers like to drop toys on my toes. And something convenient for when we go swimming at the rec center. I usually wear a true 6.5. Ordered the 6 as it was my recommended size, but returned bc even though the fit was exact, it was a little too snug for my liking. So I returned for the 7.","January 19, 2022",5.0

croc_review_44,"A little bit wider than I had anticipated/expected and a little shorter in terms of length. I think this may have to do with the ""unisex"" status -- perhaps it would be better to have women's and men's separate.","April 8, 2012",4.0

croc_review_103,"After 2 days, the clasp that connects the strap to the shoe unclipped didn't stay on after looking at it. It looks like it wasn't made correctly; it was missing the plastic that holds the strap to the shoe. I ended up crazy glueing it so it would hold.","June 11, 2022",1.0
croc_review_104,"After a backordered situation with the color Hot Pink, the Hot Pink Crocs arrived defective. The right shoe strap was oversized; it was floppy and didn't fit my heel like the left Croc. I will need to return the Crocs rather than exchange them because the color is never in stock.

croc_review_106,"After excitedly trying these on, I realized that the plasticky feeling nubs inside these Crocs were not for me. The bumpy nubbly sole bothered the soles of my feet. I was too aware of the soles of my feet & this particular style of Crocs drove me batty. I need furry lined Crocs so that my feet are happier!","December 26, 2021",3.0

croc_review_108,"After having surgery on my knee, I was looking for a comfortable shoe with support. I fell in love with the color purple, and chose a size 8. I usually wear an 8 1/2. They fit perfect and are so comfortable, I wear them to work, and my feet or knee does not hurt at the end of the day. The width is just right since I also have wide feet.","November 26, 2021",4.0
croc_review_109,"After having tried on a few pairs in store to be sure of the fit, I ordered w8 in mineral blue and orange sorbet. The mineral blue came and fit absolutely perfectly. They're super comfortable and feel great. The orange sorbet, a new color, is completely different. It's longer, wider, thicker, boxier, both visually and in feel. It fits completely different. It also feels like a different density/cushiness from the crocs I know and love. Additionally, the inside had a different texture - it's smoother, which feels like it'll cause blisters, and the little nubs are smaller and more subtle; definitely much less comfy. I wish crocs would cover return shipping; I ordered from this website hoping for consistency, or these are either defective or the new colors are way different and much worse.","August 15, 2021",1.0
croc_review_110,"After many months of trying to convince my husband to get a pair, he caved in, and his only complaint was why did he wait. He uses them indoors, more like slippers but loves them.","September 28, 2021",5.0
croc_review_111,"After more than 15 years, I've traded in my black Crocs for an orange/red ala Mario Batatlie. I LOVE THEM! Comfortable, stylish, and ""cool"". I'm a 75-year-old male, and if anyone thinks they're too flashy, TO BAD!","August 26, 2022",5.0

croc_review_118,"Alas and alack, I ordered these due to a nurse SWEARING they were the best thing EVER. But they were WAYY too big for my size 7 foot.

croc_review_148,"Amazing Simplicity- I had to chime in on the Crocs rage. This is all you need for footwear. The comfort cannot be beat. In a nutshell, they are light, airy, and carefree. Forget the socks! Who needs them? They don't get smelly. How many shoes can be worn without socks = smelly? None I have found. They float if you drop one in the lake. If you do not like the look of the strap, it comes right off. Functional performance footwear that rivals any thing you can put on your feet.","March 2, 2006",5.0

croc_review_154,"Amazing shoes; I wear them every day at our house. My feet always hurt, and these give me relief!

I normally wear a women's 8.5 - 9, depending on the shoe, and based on the measurements on the Crocs site, I ordered a women's size 9 in this classic style (in black). It fits exactly as it should - with a comfortable amount of space both in the toe box and behind my heel. The shoes are wider than my foot, but should be, according to the description of the Crocs Classic - they're not supposed to be fitted. Anyway, they're comfy as hell - pretty squishy, and super light. Personally, I keep the strap up and wear these like a clog so that I can just slip into them and go. Stylish they are not, but they're perfect for the purposes of going out to the mailbox, taking out the dogs, gardening, running to the gas station, grocery, or attending to any other casual errand. I'm not wearing these to church or for a night out on the town - that's neither what they're intended for, nor the basis upon which they should be reviewed.

They run true to size and run a little wide (I have skinny feet), which is no problem. And a little pro tip is to trade the strap with people (they have to be within a size of you though).

And in the winter, wearing warm socks or the lined Crocs, I don't have to fiddle with heavy boots for a quick trip outside. In most shoes, I wear a women's 9 wide. When I order Crocs, I buy a men's 9, which is equivalent to a women's 11, or so they say.

I was on vacation in the Philippines, and my feet were swollen and sore from all the walking and being cooped up on the airplane for so many hours. I was in the mall, saw a Crocs store, and decided to see what they had. As soon as I tried a pair on, I knew I had to have them. The design seems so simple, but they made my feet feel amazing. There's just something about the material and the pattern on the sole that really treats my poor old feet right. To this day, I wear Crocs every single day. Nothing else really compares. I have fairly flat feet, so a lot of shoes I've tried have an arch support that is way too extreme and causes me a lot of pain, but Crocs are perfect in that regard for me. I keep the heel strap flipped up when I'm around the house for easy on/off, and strap it around the back of my foot if I'm driving or walking in town. I know a lot of people probably think they're expensive for the material that goes in them, but once you've tried a pair, you'll put away all those other expensive shoes you own and realize that the value is in the design and comfort. I have 4 pairs of Crocs right now, but I like the classic clog the best. I buy my normal shoe size and they fit fine, never had any sizing issues.","May 22, 2020",5.0
croc_review_607,"Crocs have been on my radar for years. Honestly, I never thought they were that attractive of a shoe, but everyone would talk about the comfort. I recently moved into a new apartment with very hard floors that upset my arches, so I figured they'd be good house shoes, and boy was I right! Once they broke in, they're super comfy, easy to clean, and keep my feet happy. Worked up the nerve to run a quick errand in them the other day, and no one booed me out of the store, so this could be a new, comfy chapter in my life!","August 8, 2021",5.0
croc_review_608,"Crocs have changed. I recently ordered the black classic (size 9). My previous green crocs (size 9) are showing wear. Changes I noted: black crocs are a size shorter in length. Green crocs made in USA; black crocs made in Vietnam. The little nubs on the old green crocs insole are low profile and non abrasive. The new crocs had prominent sharper nubs (not comfortable unless wearing socks). Black crocs: the width was fair, but but felt a little tight and rubbed on my hammertoes. Was able to stretch them by inserting 3 lb hand weights into the toe area of shoes overnight. Was able to make them work, but not happy with the changes.","July 13, 2022",1.0

croc_review_665,"Do you really need one more Croc review to convince you to buy these shoes? Never in a kabillion years did I think I'd ever buy a pair of Crocs. Nope, not my style, not my vibe, and not me, ever. But the husband had plantar fasciitis in one of his feet, and the pain was incredible. There are several options for shoes, but we're on a budget, and I kept reading about Crocs as a good starting point. So I ordered him some Crocs in the olive green. Then I thought, ""My husband is a big baby. I should order myself a pair, wear them around for a day, and rave about them so he'll immediately start wearing his own pair of Crocs and start healing his feet."" The thing is, I was totally gobsmacked. At first the prickly nubs in the footbed were a bit distracting, but as I started walking around in them, they became less noticeable, and within the first twenty minutes or so, my feet started to feel energized and soothed. I went outside and swept the deck and did some chicken chores, and I was just in heaven. My legs felt supported and I had this incredible feeling of a whole body support system, starting with the acupressure from the footbed nubs and the lightweight shoe material and the fabulous cushioning. These shoes haven't had enough time to mold to my feet, and I'm already blissed out wearing them. I got mine in the olive green, too. They're earthy and surprisingly cute. My husband hasn't worn a clog in his entire life and walked off wearing them for the first time as if little elves were sitting inside his shoes and if he stepped down too hard, they'd get squished and died. A few minutes later, I saw him disappear down the hill at the back of our property. He can't walk when he gets home, his feet are in that much pain.","May 25, 2023",5.0

croc_review_4941,"It feels great! The manufacturer recommends that you order Crocs a size or so smaller than you order a dress shoe. That was not the case in my case.

croc_review_2136,"I felt a tingly dissolve of pain crawl up my foot, leg, and back the moment my foot hit ONE shoe! I'm sad to take them off for any reason. All I can say now is that I wish I hadn't waited so long (several years) to try them. I prefer the fit as a true size 7 when the heel strap is up over the bridge of my foot. When the heel strap is back behind my heel, it takes about a half size off the shoe, causing my toe to touch the front edge. I prefer space, and if you're like me, you may want to consider this when choosing your size. The way the shoe is built, however, the heel strap is not necessary, as my foot holds securely in place without use of the strap. Happy walking (or standing or sitting).","June 3, 2021",5.0

I wear 9.5 size shoes and there were no half sizes. It was recommended to get the next size up — size 10. So, that's what I did. The pair that I received was large enough for Bigfoot — at least in comparison with my size. And the plastic projectiles spurting from the sole felt like some form of Medieval torture device.

Something is amiss with Crocs manufacturing. We have the old and new pairs, and the new pairs are all shorter than the old pairs. Unfortunately, when we try the next size up, it is always too big.

croc_review_894,"Full disclosure: I am a Zappos employee, but I really have to say how wonderful these shoes are. I can't walk around barefoot at home (it hurts my hips, back, and feet), so these have been AMAZING for working around the house, cooking, and cleaning, etc. It's a great alternative to my UGG slippers because I don't have to worry about getting them dirty since you can clean them so easily. They also add an extra layer of underfoot and top-of-foot protection, which is great because I AM A KLUTZ! I am constantly dropping things in the kitchen—knives, scissors, you name it! As for sizing, I wear a 9.5 in running shoes, but a 9 in this specific style fits perfectly for me. Also, I HIGHLY recommend buying multiple colors for different uses. I have 4 colors in the Classic Clog design—candy pink (my inside crocs), pool (my work-outside crocs), pepper (red), and white. Important to note: I bought my red and white crocs SPECIFICALLY so I could mix and match them during the holidays. It made me feel more festive at home and when I went out to holiday parties! I even got some holiday Jibbitz on the Crocs website (and I might have gotten a few off-brand Jibbitz elsewhere—sorry, I couldn't resist!). Anyways, these are great. And they will make your feet feel great. And they could maybe protect you from yourself if you're a klutz in the kitchen, too.","January 11, 2020",5.0

The w11 were slightly smaller than my old w10, and the w12 were slightly bigger. Wore both pairs around the house for a bit before I finally decided to keep the slightly smaller w11 since I'll mostly be wearing them without socks and with thin socks.

I had never had a pair of Crocs, but I kept thinking she needed some kind of shoe that could be washed and rinsed in her sink, and Crocs came to mind. I got her a pair in size 9. She wears an 8 1/2, but this leaves room for socks because her feet are always cold. She LOVES them. She can slip them on or someone can help her use the heel strap if she's going to be taking a walk around the block. This is the perfect solution to my problem of buying athletic shoes and having them ruined in a washer and dryer. Plus, there are no laces to get knotted.

croc_review_1967,"I bought these to use as camp shoes after trying a bunch of other options. They're practical (lightweight, easy on/off, rinse clean), but they are not really very comfortable. The little nibs on the footbed irritate the soles of my feet, and I won't be doing much walking in them. However, they are practical. I must note that the sizing is awkward. I normally wear a women's 9W, and these are more than wide enough (probably because they're really men's sizes -- unisex sizing is a joke). However, a 9 is WAY too big. Size 8 fits as long as I don't try to use the back strap. If I put that around the back of my foot, my toes are jammed into the tip of the shoe.

I can slip these babies on and do what quickly needs to get done. 2 - For wet gardening. I use these while I'm adjusting the sprinklers. I have to do that every month or so. Instead of shoes and socks getting soaked, these get wet and muddy. A quick squirt of the hose and they're all clean. Backpacking - Crocs are my go-to shoes for camp.

They also give me a little height which weirdly helps me stand up straighter. I walk my dog two miles a day in them. I really recommend that anyone whose feet bother them try them.

croc_review_2513,"I have over 20 pairs of crocs, and lately, the last 5 pairs I've purchased have all fit differently. I'm usually a men's 8 & recently bought a red pair of the classic clog. They were entirely too big, which made no sense because I have pink ones the same size that fit perfectly. I purchased a purple pair & decided to size down & get a men's 7 & they were way too small (which also made no sense because I have blue crocs the same size that were a more snug fit). My suggestion is to either make half sizes, or stop with this whole ""Roomy Fit"" thing that you all are doing. There is zero reason why each pair of crocs should have a different fit. I'll never order crocs online again. I highly recommend just going to the store to make your purchase. The return process is also very strenuous because Crocs does not offer exchanges. So now I have to send them back to the store via UPS, wait for my return to be processed, then wait until I can make my way to a crocs store because the closest store in my area is 36.6 miles away.

But when I get a new pair, they always feel loose and slightly big, but deep in my mind, I know down the line they will eventually mold to my feet. I always store them inside my house and never leave them exposed to the outside elements. My conclusion is that while they are being worn and exposed to the sunny California weather, the material shrinks. Nevertheless, it's a good thing.","October 18, 2022",4.0

croc_review_4095,"I recently purchased the Crocs Classic Clog, and I have to say, I'm impressed. These shoes are incredibly comfortable and versatile. I love that I can wear them around the house, to run errands, or even to work. The foam material of the clogs is soft and cushy, which makes them perfect for long walks or standing for extended periods. They also offer excellent arch support, which is a bonus for someone like me who struggles with plantar fasciitis. Another thing I appreciate about these clogs is how easy they are to clean. A quick rinse under the faucet or a gentle scrub with a soft brush is all it takes to get them looking like new again. Overall, I highly recommend the Crocs Classic Clog to anyone looking for a comfortable and durable pair of shoes.

I did find them to run a tad large (maybe a 1/2 size), although I'm not sure if that's just the fit.

croc_review_4106,"I returned both orders I placed. It took a second time to realize that Croc's changed the material, shape, and sizing of their shoes. I will NEVER purchase another pair of Croc's shoes from Crocks. I talked with friends about this, and everyone who owns Croc's in the past said the same thing. They now hurt your feet because they are hard and do not flex like they used to do. And the room for the toes is smaller, rubbing the toes and giving them blisters. I have injuries to my feet, and Croc's were the only shoe I could wear in comfort, but no more; I am in search of a different shoe and will NEVER trust Croc's again.

But instead, I read online that you can shrink them in a dryer. I followed that online procedure, and they are now a perfect fit. You shouldn't have to do that, and the company should investigate why their quality is now subpar to what it used to be. I have a discontinued men's classic black sandal with the back strap from Vietnam and simply love them out of the box. Please bring those back. You couldn't keep them in stock.

Just what my dogs need after running or trail hiking +miles. OK. The fit is weird, and my foot is not shaped like a Croc, so my middle toe is first to run up against the front. So get used to wearing a pair that's too big. The Croc people say to leave 1/4-1/2 inch of space all around, and that is right. With time, the shoe will conform to your foot. And with lots of room in the shoe, there's less friction to abide your sore soles. Here's the trick: to get the back strap to stay up, just cut a washer out of cardboard and insert it around the rivet between the strap and the shoe. Presto!","June 28, 2012",5.0

They're also nice and light, so it's easy to carry them while backpacking so that I can escape my sweaty hiking boots at the end of the day. My only criticism comes more in the form of a ""heads up""; once the tread wears down, they can be very slippery on solid wet surfaces like polished garage floors and river rock.

croc_review_4369,"I wanted to love these because they were recommended as super comfortable by several family members, but they were so wide and huge that I felt like they were going to fall off, even with the heel strap on. They were nice and cushy, but that unfortunately made one of my ankles hurt from rolling outward. (I sprained that ankle years ago, so perhaps it needs firmer support than the flexible sole provided, although I don't have ankle pain in any other shoes or even slippers. This may not be an issue for you.) I already sized down a half size, wore wool socks, and they were still huge on me. I don't think sizing down any more would help because the problem is mostly about width/volume, not length. I have a relatively low foot volume, so if you have wide feet or a high foot volume, these may be great for you. Unfortunately, there was no way it would work for me, so I returned them.","June 2, 2021",2.0

I have always been told Crocs are comfortable, so I thought I would finally give them a chance. I love these things! I now have three pairs. They are super comfortable and supportive. My ankle doesn't bother me when I wear them because they give me the stability I need. I have a house pair and an outside pair, and a lined pair for winter. I even bought little headlights for them because I think it's hilarious and they help when I walk my dog when it's dark out. It saves me from accidentally stepping in something when I clean up after him.","July 8, 2023",5.0

They are the perfect shoe to wear after a long day of wearing work boots. Even on days I don't wear my boots, I wear my Crocs because they are super comfortable. I would definitely recommend getting a pair if you have not done so already. The pins on the Crocs are really cool too.

It's a 545 mile bicycle ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles where we raise money for services to HIV+ patients. The ride involves six nights of camping. It's a huge event and the evenings involve a lot of walking. We are allowed 70lbs of gear, but we have to haul our gear to our tent site every night, so traveling light is important. I wanted one pair of shoes for the week that I could put on after riding my bike all day and they would be comfortable enough to wear all week. I wanted one pair of shoes that wasn't going to get icky if the grass was wet at the campsite in the morning. I wanted one pair of shoes that kept my feet warm while I was walking around the campsite in the evening. These shoes totally fit the bill. After beating up my feet all day in cleats on the bike, they were a welcome respite. They allowed air to flow, but my feet never got cold at night. Dirt just wiped off. If I got some gravel in them, it kicked right back out. These shoes were so comfortable I found myself next to the gear trucks digging through my bag to find them and put them on. I know a lot of athletes use Crocs after their activity to kick around in, and these shoes are the shiznit!","June 20, 2012",5.0

I completely understand that the vast majority of people have feet that fit comfortably in the standard size, but I wish there was an option to get them even roomier/with a bigger opening, even if they cost more. I'm still wearing the ones I got, hoping they stretch out, but for now, my foot goes in just barely enough for my heel to fit in, but the top part of my foot gets pushed back and it gets painful. I've read that I can boil them to stretch them out, and I plan to do that soon, but it would've been nice to just have them fit from the get go in a size for people with extra doughy feet.

It's disappointing because the color I desire is sold out of the size 9. I was planning on wearing them usually with the strap down behind my arch, but the strap is a bit smaller than the length of the croc which only causes more discomfort for my toes. I'm hoping that the strap stretches a bit with time/wear and becomes the perfect fit. They do, however, fit fine if I keep the strap up and just wear them as slide on clogs.","May 4, 2022",4.0

So I did some research and found that some were shrinking them by putting them in the dryer with two wet towels. With no intentions of returning them (because shipping took a freaking month), I decided to try it out. IT WORKED. Like a charm. I put my dryer on the lowest setting for almost an hour and it barely shrunk, but put it on high for about 3-4min and it shrunk perfectly. I heard you can also do the same thing to stretch them out as well, but I haven't tried. They've kept their size since I've shrunk them and have been great to wear.

I hated them aggressively for all this time, but was simultaneously attracted to them. Like that boy you hated in middle school but drunkenly hooked up with and subsequently fell in love with when you ran into him on a subway platform in Brooklyn after college. These bright yellow danish ladles of rubber sunshine kept rearing their way into my heart and finally, after what seems like it could only be caused by a year-long global pandemic, onto my feet. And I couldn't be happier. I've worn them around the house, in my garden*, to work, and ""out"" to social events with friends. People seem to accept them in a way they never would have before we all emerged with 15-30 extra pounds of breakfast burritos on our socially distanced bodies. I've even received compliments or at least nods of understanding. I've been converted to the Croc kingdom, and I encourage you all to hop on the train with me.

After two bouts of plantar fasciitis and the onset of middle age, I decided to bite the bullet and try a pair. Now I just feel silly for not buying them years ago! They're so comfortable I've been hopping out of bed, directly into my Crocs since I got them. I don't experience the same level of foot pain or leg fatigue either. (I'm an artist, so I'm on my feet for hours painting.) I'd suggest buying the cheapest pair if you have doubts. That's what I did, and I wasn't disappointed at all.

I'm keeping them because any more room in the heel and they'll slip off--they're extraordinarily comfortable on all counts. Half-sizes would make a real difference in these shoes.

I mean... the strap is great because it really keeps the clog on your feet, unlike other clogs out of which I tend to slide, but... the clog is a pain because it really keeps the clog on my feet... even when I'm trying to take them off. Yeah, you can flip the clog forward if you need to be in and out of them often and that does help, but it still catches a bit. I guess I wish the strap would go just a bit further forward and stay there... when I want it to.","February 20, 2006",4.0

But my friend told me that Crocs were the way to go when I complained about how exhausted my feet were. They are roomy, comfortable, and they seriously just melt on your feet. They can be worn with or without socks.

When I push the heel support (for lack of a better name, but you get the idea) in place, it pushes my foot into the toe of the shoe, making it uncomfortable. Without it, the shoe fits fine.

Only the ugly black, brown, bright yellow colors were available in both men and women's sizes. The availability of colors was extremely limited both on line and at the outlet store here in Oklahoma City. I even waited and watched for several months hoping to get a better selection of colors. The CEO of Croc shoes was on national television a few months ago saying how many Croc shoes they had donated to health care workers. In the background behind this CEO was a display of all the beautiful colors Croc shoes come in, misleading the consumer because many of these colors were not available. I finally had to buy two pairs at the outlet mall and the other two pairs on line. I still did not get the colors I wanted.

It's not an exaggeration to say that Crocs have transformed my life in every conceivable way. Let's talk about comfort. The first time I wore Crocs, it was like walking on clouds made of marshmallows. I couldn't believe how the cushioning embraced my feet, providing a level of coziness that is simply unrivaled. With every step, it was as if the stresses of the world were melting away. Crocs' design is a testament to ergonomic brilliance, cradling my feet and supporting every arch and curve with gentle precision. But comfort alone wouldn't be enough if it weren't for the astonishing versatility of Crocs. These shoes are not confined to any single realm; they effortlessly transition from indoor havens to outdoor adventures. Whether I'm gardening, taking a leisurely stroll, or even embarking on a spontaneous hike, Crocs are my unwavering companions. The fact that they are waterproof just adds another layer of practicality that has rescued me from countless unfortunate situations. And oh, the style! Gone are the days when comfort meant compromising on aesthetics. Crocs have shattered that stereotype into a million pieces.

croc_review_6789,"So 2 stars for great color, but bad quality control. I purchased the army green classic clog. I take a 7 in Crocs, but these were huge. I brought them back to the local store. We checked to make sure I didn't order men's clogs, but these were women's. A clerk agreed they were way bigger than other size 7s. Someone said it depends where they are made—some are made in China, some in Mexico, and some in Vietnam. You need better quality control, Crocland. The store didn't have this color. Boo. I exchanged them for a hot pink pair, and of course, bought a white pair too.","July 21, 2022",2.0

But wanting a quick slip-on shoe that was easy to clean and practical, I found myself looking at my nemesis. Honestly, I'm embarrassed to say these are the most comfortable things I've had on my feet. They are great for quick tasks like gardening, etc. and comfortable enough to go for hikes. I actually really like them, so call me a hypocrite. But they are really ugly though.","May 5, 2021",5.0

When I was ordering my new pair, I noticed some reviews saying that they are now made too narrow. Well, after putting them on and comparing them to my old ones, I can say yes, they are a bit narrower than they were and are a little less loose-fitting but not tight. After a few days, they do feel like they have stretched a little. I was used to my old pair and those were really loose and also stretched out from years of use, so yea, it's gonna feel different. But overall, they're the same comfy crocs that I know.","July 29, 2021",5.0

croc_review_6931,"So... Like many other people have said.. These things shrink. I left mine in the car. I'm sure there's some fine print warning, but they need to put a GIANT sign on these shoes warning you that they can shrink. No one reads the tags on their shoes. It's like socks or baseball caps..

croc_review_7078,"The ""fit"" review is based on my personal experience with the classic clog. The review is mainly about the colorway. Actually, I bought these as a birthday gift for someone who says they hate Crocs & thinks they look so ugly. I don't think they've ever tried on a pair though! Looks are subjective, but can't deny the comfort and practicality of Crocs. I have a couple pairs myself and I don't care about the negative things people say about 'em. This grey colorway is very nice in person... and goes well with all sorts of charms since it's a neutral color. I know she likes the Warriors, Mexican food, and coffee... so I added a few charms for her... might change the way she thinks about Crocs, who knows?","August 21, 2023",5.0

It doesn't really bother me that they're made in China because I own 11 pairs of crocs and they're all comfortable but don't advertise falsely.

When I put them side by side with my (several) old pairs, they are so much wider that you can see them without measuring. My feet are not particularly narrow - just average. Crocs have always fit fine before. When I complained, I was told that Crocs recently changed suppliers, and the measurements may have changed. I guess that means I can't wear them anymore.

croc_review_7709,"These are my first Crocs, and lavender seems to run *almost* a size small. I would say the size 8 Crocs in lavender fits closer to 7 than size 8 street shoes.

If you can, try them on. When I measured my feet and checked the Crocs size chart, it said I was a size 10, which would have been way too big. Size 8 lavender fit me roomy but comfortable, whether I'm barefoot or wearing thick, fluffy socks, with or without the Crocs shoe strap. They're super comfy!","February 26, 2023",5.0

croc_review_7731,"These are not exactly the same as the older classic Crocs. These have many round holes on the top of the toe area, whereas the originals were solid on the top. The additional holes allow more dirt, grit, and water to enter through the top of the shoe. Since I got them to wear while cleaning in an animal shelter, I prefer that miscellaneous gook and water not be able to ooze in onto the top of my foot. Also, as someone else mentioned, the khaki color is much softer in the bed than is the navy pair. Khaki is made in Mexico, navy in Italy. The plastic material in the khaki shoe is also more comfortable. I found them true to size, and they stay on my narrow feet, amazingly. I got these because of an ankle injury which makes wearing even sneakers very painful. I subtracted a star because of the newer styling, which in my opinion may have been done to save on materials.","August 2, 2015",4.0

croc_review_7735,These are not the crocs I had so many years ago when they first arrived on the scene. The footbed is significantly stiffer than I remembered.

He called me excited just to say that he tried them on and really liked them. Later, he called me to tell me that his new Crocs might be the only shoe he ever wears anymore because they are so great. My dad also mentioned that he likes the circulation nubs in the sole and the flexibility of the heel strap, which he prefers to wear to the front. He thinks everyone should have a pair and even mentioned that the White House should have a pair because Presidents need good shoes.

I wonder why Zappos doesn't cross reference Crocs since they are for men and women... Oh, well. The shoes are very comfortable. I haven't had heel spur problems since wearing them.

croc_review_9060,"Well, first off, mine does not have that little red and blue ditty on the right side kind of above the pinky toe. Yet, my hopes for these shoes are they will provide an encasement for my feet to live in while I am on the move. You see, my feet have this condition in the toe area that creates an uncomfortableness where my feet sweat around the toes. And interestingly enough, you all have designed the shoes to give air to that area. Having the color white promotes cleanliness or the showing of dirt to be able to keep the insides clean, and that has been a major challenge with all other pairs of shoes. So A New Start is happening with this pair of Crocs. The journey shall not be short in time or distance. Medicine dictates. I truly hope you all support me in the quest for healthiness at the ripe age of 68 May 12th. I have some more walking to do, and your shoes are going to be the foundation for my footing.

I don't fit into any of those categories, but when a family member bought me a pair for my birthday, I fell in love with them the moment I put them on. They are so much spongier and more comfortable than they look. I feel like I'm getting a foot massage every time I wear them! Mine are a lovely azure color. I will offer only one caveat. They tend to run large. With my wide feet, I usually wear a size 7 1/2, but had to get a 6 in these. Keep this in mind, and you will have a comfy pair of shoes to enjoy!

Perfect for a day at the beach, lounging around the house, or if you're like me, running around a college campus most of the week.

I wanted an unlined pair for summer, but I'm not sure I'm going to keep these. I need to see if my other crocs soften with time, and then I might be willing to try and break them in.

croc_review_9142,"Yeah, they're pretty good. It's pretty much the same old product they've been slinging forever. The product itself is good. The price, however, is far too high. I guess they're still making the bucks off of the Covid panic, which made consumers go for Croc's due to being able to easily clean them. After all, they're just plastic or rubber or whatever synthetic material they're made of. (However, chances are no one was going to get COVID from their shoes...that's not how it's spread.) So Croc's, in effect, raised their prices when they greatly reduced the items on sale and the promotional discounts. In other words, they profited from the Covid panic. Well, summer won't last forever. The Covid crisis will hopefully be over. I guess Croc's had better bag up their profits while they can. Ten or twelve years ago, Croc's was reportedly on the verge of bankruptcy and only narrowly avoided it. They might find themselves there again. It's not like Croc's is the only company offering this type of product anymore. Angering your loyal customers is not a sustainable business model, Croc's!","July 9, 2021",4.0

croc_review_9171,"You get what you pay for, I guess? I typically never do reviews, however since they asked, I shall giveth. So this recent pair of Crocs I purchased failed to arrive in a timely manner as the shipping services attempted to come to my home but failed to utilize the gate to be buzzed in and decided to deliver the package the following day. Oddly enough, when I looked at the tracking, it shows that when they made the failed attempt to deliver the product, the city that was reflected on the tracking wasn't even the city I reside in. So the following day, I finally received my new Crocs that I was eagerly waiting for to discover that there is a significant difference between the straps on my Crocs. The right Croc strap can barley be pushed forward whereas the left Croc strap is loose as a goose.

I like them, but will still have to get another pair that will be more like the ones I previously purchased. I wear them around town, but will still need a pair for work that are softer as I walk on a very hard floor. Sadly, remember, this was my first online purchase that was not from a gift certificate. I later learned that the site had been invaded, violated, hacked, or whatever the word is, and I needed to change my password. Probably not a big deal. So you did great, but I still need to go to the store and try on the shoes before I purchase them. I was happy with the service, the shoes were okay, but actually the shoes were disappointing.
